## Architecture

This bundle defines the following via the Eclipse e4 API:

* Context menus (including commands, handlers) within a structured selection view (like the Project Explorer)

Please note: no keyboard bindings exist in this project due them overriding the bindings
in the Eclipse 3.x plugin.
